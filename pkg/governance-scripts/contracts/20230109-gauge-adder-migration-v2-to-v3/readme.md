# GaugeAdder Migration Coordinator V2->V3

This migration supersedes the [old migration coordinator](../deprecated/20220628-gauge-adder-migration/).

This contract swaps out the GaugeAdder contract which has permissions to add gauges to the GaugeController for a new version that uses the new authorizer and authorizer adaptor entrypoint.
